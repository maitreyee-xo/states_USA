# About the project

The uploaded .py file contains the code to a guessing game which allows a user to take guesses either until it gets all the fifty states of the US correct or the user has typed in 'Exit' in the input dialog box. As the user inputs correct guesses, the corresponding state name is displayed at it's actual location on the map (which is displayed on the screen).
